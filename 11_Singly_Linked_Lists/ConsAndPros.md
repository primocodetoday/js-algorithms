## Comparisons with Arrays
### Lists 
Do not have indexes!
Connected via nodes with a next pointer
Random access is not allowed
### Arrays
Indexed in order!
Insertion and deletion can be expensive
Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

#### Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required

#### Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not

#### The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
